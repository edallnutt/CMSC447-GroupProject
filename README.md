There are example data files for the data.json and students.txt files so you can have a reference if something becomes corrupted.
To use simply rename the current data and student email files so you don't lose them and then rename data_example.json and students_example.txt.
data_example.json contains the template for a student submitting numbers and an admin, all fields are required but in no particular order.
