# CMSC447-GroupProject 
## Current Problems:
Google api key is invalid for localhost so you cannot login to site and site is not hosted anywhere so basically site is useless at the moment  
  
## Purpose:
This was a group project for a senior year class where we had to find a customer with a need, gather the requirements, and implement a solution.  
  
## Details:
The customer required a submission site for a cryptography/algorithm project where students would submit a prime number that satified certain criteria and then other students would try to factor those numbers. The site was supposed to be anonymous to all users except admins so each user was assigned random fruit names.
  
## Customer: Christopher Marron  
There are example data files for the data.json and students.txt files so you can have a reference if something becomes corrupted.
To use simply rename the current data and student email files so you don't lose them and then rename data_example.json and students_example.txt.
data_example.json contains the template for a student submitting numbers and an admin, all fields are required but in no particular order.
